Candidates should demonstrate experience in both teaching and writing poetry; they may also work in multiple genres or in a hybrid mode. We seek candidates who think critically about creative writing pedagogy, who are excited to teach undergraduates at every stage of writerly development, and who cultivate an inclusive, anti-racist classroom environment. Amherst College is one of the most diverse liberal arts colleges in the country. Nearly half of our students identify as domestic students of color, and another 11 percent are international, with non-U.S. citizenship; 16 percent are the first members of their families to attend college. Amherst is committed to providing financial aid that meets 100 percent of every student's demonstrated need, and nearly 60 percent of our students receive financial aid. Our expectation is that the successful candidate will excel at teaching and mentoring students who are broadly diverse with regard to race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, nationality, sexual identity, disability/ability, and religion. The position of writer-in-residence entails teaching three courses per year, as well as advising senior theses in creative writing. Typically, the annual course load includes two writing workshops and one critical/historical seminar; however, as a department committed to pedagogical innovation we encourage other approaches, including courses that blend creative and critical study. Candidates can expect to teach at least one poetry workshop course per year. The initial appointment is for three years, with the possibility of renewal for three additional years. Candidates must hold a terminal degree (MFA or PhD) in creative writing or have commensurate professional experience. They must have previous teaching experience. Additionally, they should have published at least one book, and must have a publishing history that includes poetry. We welcome candidates with a broad sense of current practices in the field. Although we expect candidates to be comfortable teaching a wide range of page-based traditions, we are also interested in candidates who work in multimedia/multi-arts contexts or who practice slam/performance poetry. Candidates are asked to submit a dossier electronically to https://apply.interfolio.com/123776 that includes: a letter of application addressed to Professor Kirun Kapur, a CV, one writing sample not to exceed twenty pages, and three confidential letters of recommendation. Applications received by October 1, 2023, will be guaranteed full consideration. Review of applications will continue until the position is filled. Amherst College is a private undergraduate liberal arts college with 1,800 students and more than 200 faculty members. Located in the Connecticut River Valley of western Massachusetts, Amherst participates with Hampshire, Mount Holyoke, and Smith Colleges and the University of Massachusetts in the Five-College Consortium. Amherst College is an equal opportunity employer and encourages persons of all genders, persons of color, and persons with disabilities to apply. The college is committed to enriching its educational experience and its culture through the diversity of its faculty, administration, and staff. Equal Employment Opportunity Statement Statement of Non-Discrimination Amherst College does not discriminate in admission, employment, or administration of its programs and activities on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin, color, religion, sex or gender (including pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender expression, and gender identity), age, disability, genetic information, military service, or any other characteristic or class protected under applicable federal, state, or local law. Amherst College complies with all state and federal laws that prohibit discrimination, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, Title IX, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Equal Pay Act and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. Inquiries should be addressed to the Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, Amherst College, P.O. Box 5000, Amherst, MA 01002-5000.
